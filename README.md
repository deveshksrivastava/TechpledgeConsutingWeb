Using a physical device
If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable and following the instructions here.

Using a virtual device
If you use Android Studio to open ./AwesomeProject/android, you can see the list of available Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) by opening the "AVD Manager" from within Android Studio. Look for an icon that looks like this:

Running your React Native application

Step 1: Start Metro
First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.
RUN - //starts Metro Bundler.Metro is a lot like webpack—for React Native apps.Bundling isn't the same as compiling, but it can help improve startup performance and translate some platform-specific JavaScript into more JavaScript.
$npx react-native start 

Step 2: Start your application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. 
Run the following:

npx react-native run-android

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android emulator shortly.
npx react-native run-android is one way to run your app - you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

Modifying your app
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

Open App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
Press the R key twice or select Reload from the Developer Menu (Ctrl + M) to see your changes!
That's it!
Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
